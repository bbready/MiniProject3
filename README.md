# MiniProject3
This project caculates different methods of ranking teams in the NFL. The methods include the Bradley-Terry model, ELO, power rankings, and a Bayesian power ranking. All work was completed in R.

In this project there are three separate files. The pdf file contains a knitted, clean version of the document, with code and written details throughout. I have also uploaded the markdown document used that contains all of the code details, as well as a STAN file that contains details for how the Bayesian rankings were calculated.
